# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

## Overview
Fraud is one of the most critical challenges in the **financial sector**, leading to substantial revenue losses. Studies estimate that organizations lose around 5% of their annual revenue to fraudulent activities, translating to trillions of dollars in global losses. Machine learning provides an efficient approach to detecting fraud by analyzing large transactional datasets, identifying unusual patterns, and providing alerts for potential fraudulent transactions. 

This project leverages various machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models, to build a robust fraud detection system. It incorporates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving functionalities to enhance financial security.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing using `pandas` and `numpy`
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Multiple Machine Learning Models including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  - Na√Øve Bayes Classifier
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
  - Ensemble Models: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Extra Trees
- Deep Learning Model with `Keras`
- Model Evaluation using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
- Model Saving and Loading using `pickle`

## Requirements
To run this project, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn keras tensorflow
```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it using standard scaling techniques.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in the data.
3. Train various machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
4. Implement a deep learning model using Keras.
5. Save and load trained models using pickle for future use.


## Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports to determine their effectiveness in fraud detection.
